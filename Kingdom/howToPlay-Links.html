    <h1 id="unit">Units</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Units are one of the most important thing in this game. Units can move, fight, capture <a href="#city">cities</a> and destroy <a href="#trainTent">training tents</a>.<br />
            There are multiple types of units, each with their unique stats and abilities. You can recognize type of unit by its weapon or by clicking it - type of unit is written in <a href="#infoPanel">right panel</a>.<br />
            You can move units by clicking the unit - selecting it - and then clicking on another tile. You can <strong>Ctrl + Click</strong> or <strong>Alt + Click</strong> on any tile to storno unit
            movement and deselect the unit.<br />
            When you want to attack any enemy unit, first move next to it and then <strong>Click</strong> target unit.<br />
            Units can be trained in <a href="#city">cities</a> or, for 150% of the original price, in <a href="#trainTent">training tents</a>.<br />
            Training tents can be built by any unit for some resources on any tile, that is 'Land' type and has no resource and no city there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="city">City</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Cities are very important, they give you <strong>resources</strong> (money) every turn, that can be used for training <a href="#unit">units</a>, building <a href="#trainTent">training tents</a> and more. You can also train units here. <br />
            When you lose all cities, you lose the game. Capture all of them to win. <br />
            Cities also heal all your units a little each turn. <br />
            City can be captured by doing this:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1) Move your unit to neutral or enemy city <br />
                    2) Wait there 1 turn <br />
                    3) <strong>Ctrl + Click</strong> the city (select it) and click <strong>Capture</strong> button
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="resource">Resource</h1>
    <span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This text is about Resource - building, not Resources - money</span>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Resource is something, you can rebuild. Rebuilded resources gives prosperity points to nearest <a href="#city">city</a>, making their output bigger. <br />
            Rebuilding resources costs resources (money). You can rebuild only resources, that are near your cities.<br />
            You can rebuild resources by selecting them and clicking <strong>Rebuild</strong> button.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="trainTent">Recruit Tents</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Training tents can be built by any <a href="#unit">unit</a> at any 'Land' tile that has no <a href="#resource">resource</a> and no <a href="#city">city</a>. <br />
            Building tent costs some resources, but thanks to it, you can train units for 150% of its original price anywhere on the battlefield! <br />
            You can build Training Tents by selecting unit at right place and clicking <strong>Build Recruit Tent</strong><br />
            Be carefull, when any enemy unit stays at least one turn in your Recruit Tent, the Tent is destroyed and your enemy receives 70% of its cost. 
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="infoPanel">Info Panel</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Info Panel is block of text in right side of screen (ingame), that shows information about currently selected object. <br />
            In Info Panel are also located buttons that are used to end turns, recruit units, capture cities, etc.
