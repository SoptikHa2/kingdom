    <h1 id="unit">Units</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Units are one of the most important thing in this game. Units can move, fight, capture cities and destroy training tents.<br />
            There are multiple types of units, each with their unique stats and abilities. You can recognize type of unit by its weapon or by clicking it - type of unit is written in right panel.<br />
            You can move units by clicking the unit - selecting it - and then clicking on another tile. You can <strong>Ctrl + Click</strong> or <strong>Alt + Click</strong> on any tile to storno unit
            movement and deselect the unit.<br />
            When you want to attack any enemy unit, first move next to it and then <strong>Click</strong> target unit.<br />
            Units can be trained in cities or, for 150% of the original price, in training tents.<br />
            Training tents can be built by any unit for some resources on any tile, that is 'Land' type and has no resource and no city there.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="city">City</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Cities are very important, they give you <strong>resources</strong> (money) every turn, that can be used for training units, building training tents and more. You can also train units here. <br />
            When you lose all cities, you lose the game. Capture all of them to win. <br />
            Cities also heal all your units a little each turn. <br />
            City can be captured by doing this:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    1) Move your unit to neutral or enemy city <br />
                    2) Wait there 1 turn <br />
                    3) <strong>Ctrl + Click</strong> the city (select it) and click <strong>Capture</strong> button
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="resource">Resource</h1>
    <span style="font-size: 1.2em;">This text is about Resource - building, not Resources - money</span>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Resource is something, you can rebuild. Rebuilded resources gives prosperity points to nearest city, making their output bigger. <br />
            Rebuilding resources costs resources (money). You can rebuild only resources, that are near your cities.<br />
            You can rebuild resources by selecting them and clicking <strong>Rebuild</strong> button.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="trainTent">Recruit Tents</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Training tents can be built by any unit at any 'Land' tile that has no resource and no city. <br />
            Building tent costs some resources, but thanks to it, you can train units for 150% of its original price anywhere on the battlefield! <br />
            You can build Training Tents by selecting unit at right place and clicking <strong>Build Recruit Tent</strong><br />
            Be carefull, when any enemy unit stays at least one turn in your Recruit Tent, the Tent is destroyed and your enemy receives 70% of its cost.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="infoPanel">Info Panel</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Info Panel is block of text in right side of screen (ingame), that shows information about currently selected object. <br />
            In Info Panel are also located buttons that are used to end turns, recruit units, capture cities, etc.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="research">Research</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Research is important part of the game. It allows you to build more than 2 basic units (warrior and explorer) and the last research even allows you to
            build the strongest unit in the game, the Musketeer! Researches also helps you other ways, like unlocking important buildings or healing units even on battlefield. <br />
            To research technologies, click the <strong>Research</strong> button in info panel. Researching costs both resources (money) as well as some amount
            of turns. Researches also have some requirements, like req. Science Level or some previous researches. <br />
            Science level can be increased by building any science building in any of your cities. Science level depends on buildings in your cities, so you can loose it
            when your city is captured.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="building">Buildings</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>
            Buildings can be built in every city, you can build them by clicking the <strong>Build</strong> button while your city is selected.
            Some buildings require some researches to be done before, but all of them require some amount of resources to start building and
            few turns to finish building.<br />
            Buildings are very important, some of them increase defensive power of units in the city, some increase your science level and most of them
            increases city prosperity points.
